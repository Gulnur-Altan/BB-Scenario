## Exercise 3

# Challenge Variables

Write a code that prints your name, surname, age, and whether you are a student or not to the screen.
name           -> string <br />
surname        -> string <br />
age            -> integer <br />
student or not -> boolean 

Let's create a new page <br />
named-> ```variables2.go```

Example Code:

```
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
age := 25
name := "Alice"

fmt.Println("Name:", name)
fmt.Println("Age:", age)
}
```


Write the code,<br />
Run it<br />
```
go run variables2.go
```

If the output is correct, you did it. Defining variables in Golang is this easy :)
