## Exercise 3

# Challenge Variables

Write a code that prints your name, surname, age, and whether you are a student or not to the screen.
name           -> string
surname        -> string
age            -> integer
student or not -> boolean

Example Code:
```
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
age := 25
name := "Alice"

fmt.Println("Name:", name)
fmt.Println("Age:", age)
}
```

Let's create a new page.
named-> ```variables2.go```

Write the code,
Run it
```
go run variables2.go
```
If the output is correct, you did it. Defining variables in Golang is this easy :)
