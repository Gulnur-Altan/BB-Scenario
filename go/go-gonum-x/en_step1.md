### Lab Scenario: Working with Gonum Package in Golang on Alpine Linux

Objective: The objective of this lab is to familiarize participants with the Gonum package in Golang and demonstrate its capabilities for numerical computations and scientific computing.

Prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of the Go programming language.
Familiarity with Alpine Linux and working with a shell environment.

Lab Setup:

Ensure you have an Alpine Linux shell environment with Go programming language installed.
Confirm that the Gonum package is installed. If not, use the following command to install it:
```apk add gonum.org/v1/gonum/...```	

Lab Tasks:

Task 1: Basic Gonum Usage

Create a new Go file named basic_gonum.go using your preferred text editor.
Import the required packages:
```
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat"
)
//Implement a basic Gonum usage scenario:

func main() {
    // Create a 3x3 dense matrix
    a := mat.NewDense(3, 3, []float64{
        1, 2, 3,
        4, 5, 6,
        7, 8, 9,
    })

    // Print the matrix
    fmt.Println("Matrix A:")
    matPrint(a)

    // Compute the determinant of the matrix
    det := mat.Det(a)
    fmt.Printf("Determinant of A: %.2f\n", det)

    // Compute the inverse of the matrix
    aInv := mat.NewDense(3, 3, nil)
    if err := aInv.Inverse(a); err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Matrix is not invertible.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Inverse of A:")
        matPrint(aInv)
    }
}
// Utility function to print a matrix
func matPrint(m mat.Matrix) {
    formatter := mat.Formatted(m, mat.Prefix(""), mat.Squeeze())
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", formatter)
}
```
Save and exit the file.
Task 2: Running the Scenario

Compile and run the basic_gonum.go file using the following command:
```go run basic_gonum.go```

Observe the output in the terminal. It should display the matrix, its determinant, and the inverse (if invertible).
Task 3: Experimenting with Gonum

Modify the basic_gonum.go file to create additional matrices and perform various Gonum operations, such as matrix multiplication, vector operations, or eigenvalue computation.
Run the modified file and observe the results.
Lab Conclusion:
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the hands-on lab on using the Gonum package in Golang on Alpine Linux. You now have a good understanding of how to utilize Gonum for numerical computations and scientific computing tasks.

Feel free to explore more of the Gonum package's functionalities and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your understanding of its capabilities.

Note: This scenario assumes you have Go and the Gonum package properly installed in your Alpine Linux environment. Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific setup.

Remember to consult the Gonum documentation (https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum) for additional details and further exploration of the package.

Happy coding!
