## While Writing Code

### Installations
1- The first thing you need to do is to install the relevant packages in the shell environment.

Note: You should perform this step each time you open a new scenario. The environment is reset when the session is closed.

By making the necessary installations in each new scenario, the aim is to familiarize you with the commands.

*apk add go*    Installs the relevant Go package in the image.

*apk add nano*  Installs the Nano text editor, which is very useful.

(Tip: Press Ctrl + X to exit, then save and exit by typing Y).


In addition,

*vi*  
*vim*
(Tip: Activate Insert Mode with i, edit the code, exit with *Esc* + type *:wq* + press *enter* to save and exit)
other editors can also be preferred.

## Terminal

You will be using the Alpine Linux image in the Terminal screen on the right.
After writing the code, you are expected to execute it. For this purpose,

*go run xxx.go*

Replace xxx with the filename.
Or,
*go chmod u+x xxx.go*

to give permission to the file, and then execute it
 as *./xxx.go*


## Editor

On the Editor page, you can code by selecting the Go language.

You can copy and save the code you wrote by clicking on the copy icon.

You can transfer the code you wrote to the shell using the move icon on the side.

Remember to paste the code into the xxx.go page you created, not the Node ⚠️

# Node 

+ You can open a new terminal by clicking on the Node icon.

In the terminal you opened, you should perform the installations in the same way.
Since you install the packages later, the commands may not work without the installations.
Click on the port icon to access the relevant port.
