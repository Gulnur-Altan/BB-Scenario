###  Golang 101 Completed 

Remember, every great achievement begins with small steps. Learning the Go language will make you a better software developer and open up new opportunities for you. If you have the courage to start, Go can be the beginning of an exciting journey. By the way, Go developers affectionately refer to themselves as "Gophers" 😉

"Learning never exhausts the mind" ―Leonardo Da Vinci
