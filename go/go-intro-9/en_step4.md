## Code Example 4: Function as a First-Class Citizen

In Go, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from other functions. Here's an example:

```
func multiply(a, b int) int {
    return a * b
}

func applyOperation(operation func(int, int) int, a, b int) int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

func main() {
    result := applyOperation(multiply, 5, 3)
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 15
}
```
In the code snippet above, the applyOperation function accepts another function operation as an argument. In main, we pass the multiply function as the operation argument, resulting in the multiplication of 5 and 3.

## Conclusion

Go functions play a vital role in organizing and structuring code in a modular manner. They allow you to encapsulate specific tasks and reuse them throughout your program. With the examples provided in this scenario, you should now have a solid understanding of Go functions and how to use them effectively in your programs.

Remember to experiment and explore more about Go functions, as they are a versatile feature that can significantly enhance your coding experience.
