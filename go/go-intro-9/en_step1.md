## Understanding Go Functions: An Introduction with Code Examples

Go, also known as Golang, is a powerful and efficient programming language known for its simplicity and concurrency features. One of the fundamental building blocks of Go programming is the concept of functions. In this article, we'll explore the various aspects of Go functions and provide code examples to demonstrate their usage.

### Defining Functions

In Go, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can be invoked from different parts of the program to execute that task. Here's the syntax for defining a function in Go:

```
func functionName(parameter1 type1, parameter2 type2) returnType {
    // Function body
    // Code to be executed
    return result
}
```
Let's break down the components of a Go function:

func keyword: It is used to define a function.
functionName: This is the identifier for the function. Choose a meaningful name that describes the purpose of the function.
parameter1, parameter2: These are the input parameters to the function. Each parameter is followed by its respective type.
returnType: It represents the type of value the function returns. If the function doesn't return any value, the returnType is omitted.
return: This keyword is used to return a value from the function. The return statement is optional if the function doesn't have a return type.

### Code Example 1: A Simple Addition Function

Let's start with a simple example that demonstrates a function to perform addition:
File -> New File 
named-> `main.go`

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func addNumbers(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
	sum:=addNumbers(10, 20)

	fmt.Println("The sum is: ", sum)
}
```

to execute it `go run main.go` 

In the above code, we define a function named addNumbers that takes two integers, a and b, as parameters. It returns the sum of a and b as an integer. you can test the code and continue..
