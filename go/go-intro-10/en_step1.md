### Introduction to Matrices in Go

In this step, we will introduce the concept of matrices and how to work with them in Go.

#### What is a Matrix?
A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It is a fundamental data structure used in linear algebra and is commonly used in various scientific and mathematical computations.

### Working with Matrices in Go
Go provides various packages and libraries to work with matrices efficiently. One popular library is Gonum, which offers extensive functionalities for numerical computations and scientific computing.


Create a Go page with an editor. Name should be matrix.go

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var i, j, rows, columns int

    var matrix [10][10]int
    var transposeMatrix [10][10]int

    fmt.Print("Enter the Matrix rows and Columns = ")
    fmt.Scan(&rows, &columns)

    fmt.Println("Enter Matrix Elements to Transpose = ")
    for i = 0; i < rows; i++ {
        for j = 0; j < columns; j++ {
            fmt.Scan(&matrix[i][j])
        }
    }
    for i = 0; i < rows; i++ {
        for j = 0; j < columns; j++ {
            transposeMatrix[j][i] = matrix[i][j]
        }
    }
    fmt.Println("--- The Transpose Matrix Items ---")
    for i = 0; i < columns; i++ {
        for j = 0; j < rows; j++ {
            fmt.Print(transposeMatrix[i][j], "  ")
        }
        fmt.Println()
    }
}
```
Type this command
```go run matrix.go```

Now you have learned the basics of working with matrices in Go. In the next step, we will explore matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

Make sure to run and test the provided example code in your virtual terminal to see the output.
